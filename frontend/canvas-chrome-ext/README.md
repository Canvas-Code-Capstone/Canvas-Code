# Cypress Testing Environment
For this project, we are using Cypress as our testing suite for the front end code. Cypress is a web application testing
environment, with an integrated UI to help set up, write, run and debug code.
## How to run cypress
1. Open your terminal of choice and cd into `Canvas-Code/frontend/canvas-chrome-ext` folder
2. In the terminal, enter `node_module/.bin/cypress open`
2. A window will pop up with two options
   1. E2E Testing
   2. Component Testing
3. Within each of the views, you can create tests in the browser of your choice and run/debug your tests. Below are guides on how to use cypress's features
